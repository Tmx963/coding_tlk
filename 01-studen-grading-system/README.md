**Problem:**
Create a Python program that asks for a student's score and then provides a grade based on the score.

**Instructions:**
1. Ask the user to enter their score (out of 100).
2. Store the score in a variable.
3. Use conditional statements to print the grade based on the score.
    - If the score is greater than or equal to 90, print: `"Grade: A"`
    - If the score is between 80 and 89, print: `"Grade: B"`
    - If the score is between 70 and 79, print: `"Grade: C"`
    - If the score is between 60 and 69, print: `"Grade: D"`
    - If the score is below 60, print: `"Grade: F"`
