1. Create a tuple with repeated values, such as `("apple", "banana", "apple", "cherry", "banana", "apple")`.  
2. Ask the user to enter a fruit name.  
3. Print how many times that fruit appears in the tuple.  

**Example Interaction:**
```
Enter a fruit name: apple
'apple' appears 3 times in the tuple.
```

(Hint: Use the `count()` method like `tuple_name.count(value)`.)
