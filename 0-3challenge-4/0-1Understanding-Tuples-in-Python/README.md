#### **Basic Properties of Tuples:**  
- **Immutable:** Once created, elements inside a tuple cannot be changed.  
- **Ordered:** The items retain their position.  
- **Can Contain Mixed Data Types:** Tuples can store different data types, such as integers, strings, floats, or even other tuples.  
- **Allow Duplicates:** Tuples can have repeated values.  

#### **Examples:**  
```python
# Creating a tuple
fruit_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruit_tuple)  # Output: ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')

# Accessing elements
print(fruit_tuple[1])  # Output: 'banana'

# Tuple unpacking
a, b, c = fruit_tuple
