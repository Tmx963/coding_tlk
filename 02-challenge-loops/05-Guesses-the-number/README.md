Write a program that generates a random number between `1` and `10` and keeps asking the user to guess it using a `while` loop **until they guess correctly**.  

**Example:**  
```
Guess the number: 4  
Wrong, try again!  
Guess the number: 7  
Correct! 🎉
```

💡 **Hint:** Use `import random` and `random.randint(1, 10)`.
