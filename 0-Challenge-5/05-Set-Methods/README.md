Create a set `data = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}`.
- Copy the set to `data_copy` and print it.
- Use `.pop()` to remove a random element and print the set.
- Use `.clear()` to empty the set and print it.

  Example Output:  
```
Copy: {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
After pop: {20, 30, 40, 50}
After clear: set()
```
