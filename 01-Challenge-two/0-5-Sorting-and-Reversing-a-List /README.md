Create a list numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].


Using a list comprehension, create a new list even_numbers that contains only the even numbers from the numbers list.


Then, create a list squared_numbers that contains the squares of all the even numbers from the even_numbers list.


Print both the even_numbers and squared_numbers lists.


Example Output:
even_numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
squared_numbers = [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
